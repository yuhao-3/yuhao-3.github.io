<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there, I am Yuhao Li. I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Faculty of Engineering and IT at the University of Melbourne, advised by [Dr. Ling Luo](https://sites.google.com/view/lingluo) and [Prof. Uwe Aickelin](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/811137-uwe-aickelin).

I am passionate about advancing the field of **trustworthy machine learning**, with a focus on developing **robust and reliable AI systems** for healthcare applications. My research interests lie in improving the **robustness** of machine learning models in the presence of label noise and uncertainty, particularly in healthcare domains with Electronic Health Records.

*Please feel free to email me for research, collaborations, or a casual chat.*
