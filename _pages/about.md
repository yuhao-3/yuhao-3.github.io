<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Hi there, I am Yuhao Li (Mcgrady). I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, the University of Melbourne, under the supervision of [Dr. Ling Luo](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/academic-staff/ling-luo) and [Prof. Uwe Aickelin](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/uwe-aickelin).


I am passionate about advancing **robust and reliable machine learning**, with a long-term vision of developing models that can learn faithfully from imperfect, heterogeneous, and real-world data. My current research focuses on improving the robustness and trustworthiness of learning systems under practical data challenges, including but not limited to:
(1) **noisy label learning and noisy multi-label learning**, where supervision is incomplete, corrupted, or inconsistent;
(2) **multimodal learning**, with an emphasis on multimodal alignment and fusion across heterogeneous representations;
(3) **multimodal healthcare learning**, particularly modeling electronic health records that integrate structured time-series signals and unstructured clinical notes.


*Please feel free to email me for research discussions, collaborations, or a casual chat.*
