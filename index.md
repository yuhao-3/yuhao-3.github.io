## 📖 About Me

I am a 3rd year Ph.D. candidate from the Faculty of Engineering and IT at the University of Melbourne, advised by Dr. Ling Luo and Prof. Uwe Aickelin. I am passionate about advancing the field of trustworthy machine learning, particularly in the domains of robust learning and multimodal healthcare applications.

My research focuses on developing machine learning methods that can handle noisy and imperfect data, with special emphasis on Electronic Health Records combining time series and clinical notes. I am committed to building reliable AI systems for real-world healthcare applications.

Feel free to reach out for research discussions, collaborations, or a casual chat!
