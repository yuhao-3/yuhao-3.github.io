## 📖 About Me

Hi there, I am Yuhao Li. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR)](https://github.com/tmlr-group) group in the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, the University of Melbourne, under the supervision of [Dr. Ling Luo](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/academic-staff/ling-luo) and [Prof. Uwe Aickelin](https://cis.unimelb.edu.au/people/uwe-aickelin).

I am passionate about advancing the field of **trustworthy machine learning**, particularly in the domains of robust learning and multimodal healthcare applications. My current research focuses on developing machine learning methods that can effectively handle **noisy and imperfect data**, with special emphasis on Electronic Health Records combining time series and clinical notes.

In an era where AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes healthcare decision-making domains, I firmly believe that their foundations must be trustworthy and robust: not as an afterthought, but as a prerequisite for responsible and sustainable clinical integration.

*Please feel free to email me for research discussions, collaborations, or a casual chat.*
